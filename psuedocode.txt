Resource: Game

index - Map to root = home page , static page?

new (/connectfour) - form: -1 or 2 player
                    -player name (nice2have)
                    -create and save session variables

create - instantiate a game that takes players, and a newly instantiated board
          render the show page

edit - show the board status for the game (partial)
        radio button form to get piece placement column (could be invalid if col full)
        --- this form should post to update (/drop_piece)
        -- disable invalid radio buttons

update (/drop_piece) - get game variables from session
        make a move on that game, make computer move (keep it "duck" to drop a human)
        reset session cookie

show - final results, appropriate victory loss

destroy - reset_session or session[:key] = nil, redirect to home page,
          "new_game"


WHAT do we NEED in order to track the game:
  -board = 2D array -> serialize .to_json, come back w/JSON.parse()
  -current player (?)



nav links (layout) - "reset" submit to reset , destroy current game , render new

#Ruby .gitignore file template

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ruby.gitignore

# Anything starting with a tilde (~) is considered a temp object and should be ignored
# ignore any DIRECTORY which is named starting with a tilde (~)
*~/

# ignore any FILE which is named starting with a tilde (~)
~*

# below are templated parameters borrowed from here: https://github.com/phyman/gitignore/blob/master/Ruby.

gitignore
*.gem
*.rbc
/.config
/coverage/
/InstalledFiles
/pkg/
/spec/reports/
/test/tmp/
/test/version_tmp/
/tmp/

## Specific to RubyMotion:
.dat*
.repl_history
build/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

## Environment normalisation:
/.bundle/
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
